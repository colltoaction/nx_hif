# NetworkX HIF runtime

In a similar spirit to [HVM2](https://github.com/higherorderco/hvm) or [MLIR](https://mlir.llvm.org/) this project implements a round-trip transformation between the [HIF](https://github.com/pszufe/HIF-standard) intermediate representation and the [NetworkX](https://github.com/networkx/networkx) runtime for graph analysis and manipulation.
