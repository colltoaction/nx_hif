# HIF for NetworkX

The Hypergraph Interchange Format implementation makes NetworkX compatible with several higher-order graph networks using an equivalence with graphs as explained in nLab:

* https://github.com/networkx/networkx
* https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/hypergraph#hypergraphs_as_2colored_graphs

Projects participating in HIF standarization:
* [HypergraphX](https://github.com/HGX-Team/hypergraphx) (Python)
* [HyperNetX](https://github.com/pnnl/HyperNetX) (Python)
* [XGI](https://github.com/xgi-org/xgi) (Python)
* [SimpleHypergraphs.jl](https://github.com/pszufe/SimpleHypergraphs.jl) (Julia)
